The Maya civilization was one of the most sophisticated ancient civilizations in the Americas, flourishing in the tropical rainforests of present-day Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador from approximately 2000 BC to the 16th century AD. The Maya developed remarkable achievements in astronomy, mathematics, architecture, and art that continue to amaze scholars today.

The Maya constructed impressive cities with towering pyramids, palaces, and ball courts. Cities like Tikal, Palenque, and Copán featured monumental architecture with intricate carvings and sculptures. Their mathematical system included the concept of zero, and they used a sophisticated vigesimal (base-20) number system. In astronomy, they accurately predicted solar eclipses, tracked Venus cycles, and developed one of the most precise calendars in the ancient world.

The Maya created a complex writing system using hieroglyphs, representing one of the few fully developed writing systems in the pre-Columbian Americas. Their scribes recorded historical events, astronomical observations, and religious texts on stone monuments, codices, and pottery. Despite their advanced civilization, the Maya experienced a mysterious collapse in the 9th century, when many major cities were abandoned. The exact causes remain debated among scholars, with theories including environmental degradation, warfare, overpopulation, and prolonged drought.

Today, millions of Maya descendants continue to live in Central America, maintaining many aspects of their ancient culture. The ruins of Maya cities stand as testament to a civilization that achieved remarkable heights in isolation, contributing invaluable knowledge to our understanding of human potential and the complexity of ancient societies.
