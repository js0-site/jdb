Mohenjo-daro, meaning "Mound of the Dead" in Sindhi, was one of the largest cities of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, flourishing around 2600 to 1900 BC in what is now Pakistan. Discovered in the 1920s, this remarkable archaeological site provides evidence of one of the world's earliest urban civilizations, alongside its contemporary Harappa. The city demonstrates sophisticated urban planning and engineering that was remarkably advanced for its time.

The city was built on a grid system with streets laid out in perfect north-south and east-west orientations. Houses were constructed with standardized baked bricks, featuring private bathrooms, wells, and sophisticated drainage systems connected to covered sewers. The city even had a massive public bath, the Great Bath, measuring approximately 12 meters by 7 meters, which may have been used for ritual purification. The level of civic planning and public infrastructure suggests a highly organized society with strong central authority.

The Indus Valley Civilization, of which Mohenjo-daro was a major center, covered a vast area larger than Mesopotamia or Egypt at its peak. The people were skilled craftsmen, producing distinctive pottery, jewelry, and seals with undeciphered script. They engaged in extensive trade with Mesopotamia and other regions. Despite their achievements, the civilization mysteriously declined around 1900 BC, and the cities were gradually abandoned.

The causes of the decline remain uncertain, with theories including climate change, river course changes, invasion, or internal social factors. The undeciphered Indus script continues to challenge linguists and archaeologists, leaving many questions about this ancient civilization unanswered. Mohenjo-daro stands as a testament to the sophistication of ancient urban development and continues to be studied for insights into early human civilization.
