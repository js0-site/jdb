The sea was deep.
The sea was dark.
Beyond the pillars.
Beyond the known world.
An island rose.
An island fell.
Atlantis.
The name echoes through time.
The legend burns in memory.
Plato told the tale.
Plato wrote the words.
Around 360 BC.
In the dialogues.
Timaeus spoke.
Critias listened.
The story was told.
The island was real.
The island was powerful.
Poseidon founded it.
Poseidon ruled it.
His descendants reigned.
For generations.
The city was magnificent.
Rings of water.
Rings of land.
Palaces of gold.
Temples of stone.
Engineering of wonder.
The people were wealthy.
The people were strong.
Armies marched.
Navies sailed.
But power corrupts.
Wealth blinds.
The Atlanteans forgot.
They forgot wisdom.
They forgot honor.
They sought conquest.
They sought Athens.
The gods saw.
The gods judged.
The punishment came.
Earthquakes shook the ground.
Floods covered the land.
The island sank.
In one day.
In one night.
Gone.
Lost.
Forgotten.
Or was it?
For centuries, men searched.
Scholars studied.
Explorers sailed.
Enthusiasts dreamed.
Where was Atlantis?
In the Mediterranean?
In the Atlantic?
Santorini?
The Azores?
The theories abound.
The evidence eludes.
Was it real?
Was it myth?
The volcanic eruption of Thera.
1600 BC.
Santorini destroyed.
A memory preserved.
A legend born.
Or was it a lesson?
A philosophical tale.
A moral warning.
Created by Plato.
To teach.
To warn.
To inspire.
The story lives.
For two thousand years.
It inspires writers.
It inspires artists.
It inspires dreamers.
Bacon wrote of it.
Verne dreamed of it.
Films show it.
Games explore it.
Each tells their tale.
Each finds their meaning.
Science investigates.
Geologists search.
The sea levels rise.
The floods come.
The disasters strike.
Was Atlantis a memory?
Of many disasters.
Combined into one.
Into a legend.
The concept resonates.
Lost civilization.
Advanced knowledge.
Human achievement.
Human failure.
The rise.
The fall.
The mystery.
The fascination.
Plato described it well.
The geography.
The society.
The technology.
The island was vast.
Larger than Libya.
Larger than Asia.
The city was grand.
Canals flowed.
Rings alternated.
Metallurgy advanced.
Engineering sophisticated.
The politics organized.
Ten kings ruled.
Ten kingdoms united.
They met.
They decided.
They governed.
Laws were made.
Institutions built.
But corruption came.
Wealth tempted.
Power seduced.
The kings fell.
The values decayed.
The religion faded.
Temples abandoned.
Rituals forgotten.
Moral decline.
Spiritual death.
Was it a rhetorical device?
A philosophical point?
An ideal society.
A warning against corruption.
A cautionary tale.
Hubris destroys.
Decay consumes.
The search continues.
No proof found.
No evidence discovered.
Archaeology fails.
Geology fails.
The legend endures.
It captivates.
It inspires.
It haunts.
Was it real?
Was it myth?
It reminds us.
Fragility exists.
Achievements fall.
Civilizations vanish.
We seek lost worlds.
We desire hidden knowledge.
The search goes on.
Technology helps.
Underwater archaeology.
Satellite imaging.
The quest continues.
No definitive proof.
But the search has value.
Understanding grows.
History reveals.
Methods improve.
Atlantis remains.
A symbol.
A mystery.
A dream.
A lost golden age.
An advanced civilization.
A story of hope.
A story of warning.
New generations search.
New explorers sail.
New scientists study.
New storytellers write.
The legend endures.
For centuries.
For eternity.
Atlantis.
Lost but not forgotten.
Gone but not dead.
A mystery.
A dream.
A legend.
